# AP3 Motion

## Question 1

A cyclist sets out from home at time t = 0 to cycle along a straight cycle path. Figure 1a shows the displacement, x, 
against time, t, graph for the journey.

![Figure 1a: A graph of x/km vs t/min. The plot is a series of points from (0,0), to (10,3.0), to (15,3.0), to (20,4.5), to (30,4.5), to (60,0). The points are joined by a line describing the cyclists journey.]

### Question 1a

Determine the average speed of the cyclist for the entire journey.

### Question 1b

Determine the average velocity of the cyclist for the entire journey. Explain why this value is not the same as the answer to part a.

### Question 1c

Describe a graph of velocity against time for the cyclist’s journey.

## Question 4

### Question 4a

A cricket bat causes an acceleration of 3400 ms^-2 to a cricket ball travelling horizontally at 30 ms^–1. After contact with the bat, the ball is travelling at 25 ms–1 in the opposite direction to its original motion.

#### Question 4ai

Calculate the time that the ball was in contact with the bat.

#### Question 4aii

Describe how you would determine, experimentally, the speed of the cricket ball as it left the bat.
